## How to run workflow.py

I will be assuming that the user has access to the Analytix cluster.

Firstly, connect to lxplus:
```bash
ssh user@lxplus.cern.ch
```
Go to a place where you want to have the repo and clone it there:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikodemas/log-clustering.git
```

After cloning the repo go to workflow directory:
```bash
cd log-clustering/workflow/
```

Set up a new virtual environment there:
```bash
python3 -m venv new_env
```

Activate your virtualenv:
```bash
source new_env/bin/activate
```

In this environment install the packages one by one from requirements file:
```bash
cat requirements.txt | xargs -n 1 pip install
```

Also, `clusterlogs` folder must stay in the same directory as `workflow.py`.

Setup environment to use HADOOP with the following commands:
```bash
 source "/cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_96python3/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/setup.sh"
 source "/cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/etc/hadoop-confext/hadoop-swan-setconf.sh" analytix
```

Now you can run `workflow.py`:
```bash
python3 workflow.py
```

## Possible issues

One issue that I have experienced was not being able to connect to MonIT receiving the following error:
```bash
Error: 'Connection' object has no attribute 'set_ssl'
```
In my case it could be solved by running this command after the `source "/cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/etc/hadoop-confext/hadoop-swan-setconf.sh" analytix` command:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$(python3 -m site --user-site):$PYTHONPATH"
```
