# log-clustering

In "old-notebooks" one can see some of the first tests of the clusterlogs module. Some extra testing can be found here: https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/kGcKstDb1vHpcN2

In the "workflow" folder one can see my attempts of putting information from jupyter notebooks into continuous workflow.

By running the "workflow.py" script from lxplus machine the FTS error messages (messages of yesterday by default but might be changed to some other day(s)) are taken from HDFS, grouped into clusters and then sent to MonIT.
